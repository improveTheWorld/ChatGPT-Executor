*   Update the protocol to directly handle writing text to a file as generated for the user.
    
*   Enhance the protocol to support updating existing files with a patch generated from ChatGPT. This reduces the number of tokens required to modify an existing file (as ChatGPT has limited token memory). Add the ability to apply patches and save the result in a new file.
    
*   Introduce a configuration file to set the maximum word count for a prompt.
    
*   When ChatGPT is asked to read a file, start by providing the total number of lines.
       
*   Ensure compatibility with the Linux shell.
    
*   Implement the application as a background service.
