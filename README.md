# ![ChatGPT-Executor Logo](./assets/logo.jpg) **ChatGPT-Executor**

**ChatGPT-Executor is a server application that empowers ChatGPT to execute Windows commands, unlocking a wide range of applications and capabilities.**

ChatGPT-Executor is part of the [ChatGPT-Driver](youtu.be/9fCtMJQxQ4c) system, designed to seamlessly integrate ChatGPT with third-party software and enable it to execute Windows commands. To use ChatGPT-Executor, you'll also need to install the [ChatGPT-Bridge](https://github.com/improveTheWorld/ChatGPT-Bridge) browser plugin.

## üåü Features

* üí¨ Real-time execution of Windows commands generated by ChatGPT
* ‚ö° Efficient WebSocket server
* üîÑ Bidirectional communication with ChatGPT and the command execution environment
* üì¶ Easy integration with ChatGPT web plugin
* üìÑ Enable ChatGPT to read large files that exceed the size of a single prompt

## üöÄ Getting Started

You may download and install Executor from [Here](https://bit.ly/3I33M7F) 

If you want to genrate your own binaries , see the next paragraph.

### Prerequisites

* Windows operating system

### Compilation

* **Using command-line**

  Follow these instructions to compile the ChatGPT-Executor using command-line tools:

  1. Ensure you have .NET 6.0 SDK installed on your system. If not, download it from the [.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0).
  2. Open a command prompt or terminal window.
  3. If you have Git installed, you can use the following command:
   

     >`git clone https://github.com/improveTheWorld/ChatGPT-Executor.git`

  Alternatively, download the repository as a ZIP file to your local machine from [here](https://github.com/improveTheWorld/ChatGPT-Executor/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and extract it to a folder on your local machine.

  1. Change your working directory to the ChatGPT-Executor folder:

      >`cd ChatGPT-Executor`

  5. Build the solution using the *"dotnet build"* command:

      >`dotnet build`

  6. Once the build is successful, you can find the compiled executable in the "bin" folder of the project directory, under the "Release" folder.

  Congratulations! üéâ ChatGPT-Executor is now up. Luanch it on your local machine. You need now to install the [ChatGPT-Bridge plugin](https://github.com/improveTheWorld/ChatGPT-Bridge) to see it in action.
* **Using Microsoft visual Studio**

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone [https://github.com/improveTheWorld/ChatGPT-Executor.git](https://github.com/improveTheWorld/ChatGPT-Executor.git)
2. `To compile the ChatGPT-Executor, which is written in C# using Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 and targeting .NET 6.0, follow these steps:

   1. Ensure you have Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 installed on your system. If not, download it from the [official Microsoft website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).
   2. Install the .NET 6.0 SDK from the[.NET downloads page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0).
   3. download the repository as a ZIP file to your local machine from [here](https://github.com/improveTheWorld/ChatGPT-Executor/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and extract it to a folder on your local machine.
   4. Open the solution file (ChatGPT-Executor.sln) in Visual Studio 2022.
   5. Build the solution by selecting "Build" from the menu, then "Build Solution" or use the shortcut "Ctrl+Shift+B".
   6. Once the build is successful, you can find the compiled executable in the "bin" folder of the project directory, under the appropriate configuration folder (e.g., "Debug" or "Release").

   Congratulations! üéâ ChatGPT-Executor is now up. Luanch it on your local machine. You need now to install the [ChatGPT-Bridge plugin](https://github.com/improveTheWorld/ChatGPT-Bridge) to see it in action.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

After running the ChatGPT-Executor server application, you need to use it in conjunction with ChatGPT-Bridge to enable it to execute Windows commands generated by CHATGPT. For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the [ChatGPT-Bridge GitHub Repository](https://github.com/improveTheWorld/ChatGPT-Bridge).

`As an example of use, we asked ChatGPT to troubleshoot our WiFi card. We had an issue that the Windows network diagnostic tools were unable to detect. ChatGPT, after trying different approaches using our ChatGPT-Bridge system, was able to fix it for us.`[Video](https://youtu.be/9fCtMJQxQ4c)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Possible improvements

**The first relase is already on the air, here are the next steps:**

*   Update the protocol to directly handle writing text to a file as generated for the user.
    
*   Enhance the protocol to support updating existing files with a patch generated from ChatGPT. This reduces the number of tokens required to modify an existing file (as ChatGPT has limited token memory). Add the ability to apply patches and save the result in a new file.
    
*   Introduce a configuration file to set the maximum word count for a prompt.
    
*   Optimize the maximum word usage by testing the real possible limit accepted in one prompt.
    
*   When ChatGPT is asked to read a file, start by providing the total number of lines. It seems helping him to handle the frames protocol.
    
*   When the Executor asks ChatGPT to continue, it should specify the last received line and request that ChatGPT not resend previously received content.
    
*   Ensure compatibility with the Linux system /linux shell.
    
*   Make the application run as a background service.
    
*   Move the management of the initial prompt to the server side to minimize dependency on the plugin protocol and ensure ongoing compatibility between the initial prompt version and the server-implemented version. To accomplish this, add a config parameter on the plugin side that requests an initial prompt when new communication is detected. The plugin should send a command to the server, which should be independent of the protocol, such as "Send\_First\_Prompt".
